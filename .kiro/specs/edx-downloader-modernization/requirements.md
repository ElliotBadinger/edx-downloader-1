# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The EDX Downloader is a Python command-line tool that allows users to download video courses from edx.org. The current codebase has not been maintained for over 4 years and is experiencing multiple issues including JSON parsing errors, outdated dependencies, broken API endpoints, and deprecated authentication methods. This modernization effort aims to revamp the entire codebase to work with current EDX platform changes while improving code quality, maintainability, and user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the EDX downloader to work with the current EDX platform, so that I can successfully download course videos without encountering JSON parsing errors or authentication failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user provides valid EDX credentials THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with the current EDX API endpoints
2. WHEN the user provides a valid course URL THEN the system SHALL successfully parse course data without JSON parsing errors
3. WHEN the system retrieves course content THEN it SHALL handle the current EDX platform's data structure and API responses
4. IF the EDX platform returns unexpected data formats THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages instead of generic JSON parsing errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to use modern and secure Python dependencies, so that the application is stable, secure, and compatible with current Python environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL use Python dependencies that are actively maintained and security-patched
2. WHEN installing the application THEN it SHALL support Python 3.8+ and drop Python 2.7 compatibility
3. WHEN the application makes HTTP requests THEN it SHALL use current versions of requests library with proper SSL/TLS handling
4. WHEN parsing HTML content THEN it SHALL use updated BeautifulSoup4 with current parsing capabilities
5. IF dependency conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution guidance

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved error handling and logging, so that I can understand what went wrong and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages instead of generic exceptions
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate whether it's a credential issue, network issue, or API change
3. WHEN course parsing fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about the parsing failure
4. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL distinguish between connectivity issues, rate limiting, and server errors
5. IF the system encounters unexpected data structures THEN it SHALL log the actual data received for debugging purposes

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle modern EDX platform features, so that I can download content from courses that use current EDX functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing course content THEN the system SHALL handle modern EDX course structures and navigation
2. WHEN downloading videos THEN the system SHALL support current video hosting and delivery methods used by EDX
3. WHEN parsing course metadata THEN the system SHALL extract information from current EDX HTML/JSON structures
4. IF EDX uses new authentication methods THEN the system SHALL implement compatible authentication flows
5. WHEN encountering different video formats THEN the system SHALL prioritize the best available quality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to follow modern Python best practices, so that it's maintainable, testable, and extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code THEN it SHALL follow PEP 8 style guidelines and modern Python conventions
2. WHEN adding new features THEN the code SHALL be modular with clear separation of concerns
3. WHEN testing the application THEN it SHALL have comprehensive unit tests for core functionality
4. WHEN handling configuration THEN it SHALL use modern configuration management approaches
5. IF errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled with proper exception hierarchies and context

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want improved download management features, so that I can efficiently manage large course downloads with better control and resume capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN downloading large courses THEN the system SHALL support resuming interrupted downloads
2. WHEN downloading multiple videos THEN the system SHALL provide progress tracking for the entire course
3. WHEN organizing downloads THEN the system SHALL create logical folder structures based on course organization
4. IF download fails THEN the system SHALL allow retrying individual videos without re-downloading successful ones
5. WHEN bandwidth is limited THEN the system SHALL provide options to control download speed and concurrent downloads

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to respect EDX's terms of service and implement appropriate rate limiting, so that my account doesn't get banned for abuse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate delays between requests
2. WHEN downloading videos THEN the system SHALL respect server response headers for rate limiting
3. WHEN encountering rate limits THEN the system SHALL automatically back off and retry with exponential delays
4. IF the system detects potential abuse patterns THEN it SHALL warn the user and implement protective measures
5. WHEN accessing course content THEN the system SHALL only download content the user is legitimately enrolled in
